# Historical-Figures-Guesser
A program that attempts to guess the historical figure the user is thinking of based on the answers that the program receives.

The user will be asked to think of a famous historical figure of significance. The user will be asked several questions pertaining to the identity of the historical figure which will be used to identify who specifically the user is thinking of.

There are a total of 7 characteristics for each figure listed in the database that the program will attempt to retrieve. The questions will be asked randomly. There are 300 people in the database. The program also allows users to save previous correct guesses in an alternate file.

This is the first major project that I worked on. It introduced me to a variety of programming concepts and to python in general.
